1. Explain how your code meets clean code practices by using at least 3 examples of your own code.
    Examples:
    testAddMoodEntry
    testAddNullEntry
    testGetAverageMoodRating

    Methods of testing that are explanatory in naming

    Method Examples:
    getMenuChoice
    handleChoice
    validateMoodRating
    getCommonSymptoms

    All methods named as explanations
    With each method handling a single responsibility
    Handles errors well
    maintains consistent formatting to avoid duplication


2. Explain your project. What it does, how it works. Explain the test cases you used

Run Program

enter mood int 1-5
Give symptom on how you're feeling, whether anxious/happy etc. Then be able to add a note on your how you're feeling.
get your average mood
get common symptoms
when viewing mood history get timestamp
Records moods over time,

3. Outline the needed dependencies. Where did you get them from?

I used J unit for testing and Surefire for automated testing

https://mvnrepository.com/

4. If you had any problems the QAP please explain what happened.

Mental health Emergency - still not 100%. Not related to the QAP but hindered my ability by a
significant amount so this is by far my worst project to date lol
